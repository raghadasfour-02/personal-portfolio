        <h2 class="h2 article-title">My First Backcountry Camping Experience
          <p class="service-item-text-small">September 15th, 2024</p>
        </h2>

        <p class="service-item-text">
          I just wrapped up my first backcountry camping trip, and it was quite the experience. For three days, I canoed
          through Algonquin Provincial Park, camped at some beautiful sites, and tracked the whole thing with my Apple
          Watch
          Series 9. Here's how it went down. 
        </p><br>

        <!-- Day 1 -->
        <h4 class="h4 service-item-title small-article-title">Day 1: Saturday</h4>
        <p class="service-item-text">
          We started the trip with a 54-minute canoe ride to our first portage, a 270-meter stretch. The portage was a
          bit of
          a workout, but we made it through without much trouble. After that, we paddled for about an hour to our first
          campsite
          on Tepee Lake.

        <p class="service-item-text">
          The campsite itself was great. It had a barrel hanger for storing food (a must when camping in bear country),
          a nice
          bench for sitting around the fire, and an awesome campfire spot. It was the perfect setup for our first night
          in the
          wild.
        </p><br>
    
        <!-- Day 2 -->
        <h4 class="h4 service-item-title small-article-title">Day 2: Sunday</h4>
        <p class="service-item-text">
          On day two, we canoed for about 1 hour and 10 minutes to our second campsite. Unfortunately, I ran into some
          tech
          issues with the Apple Fitness Paddling option on my watch, which messed up my map and was pretty frustrating.
          The
          outhouse at this site wasnâ€™t as nice as the first one, but it was still usable.
        </p>

        <p class="service-item-text">
          The good part of the day came when we hit the beach at the campsite. We went for a swim in the lake, and it
          was
          honestly the best part of the day. The water was beautiful, and it was a great way to cool off after paddling.
        </p> <br>
        

        <!-- Day 3 -->
        <h4 class="h4 service-item-title small-article-title">Day 3: Monday</h4>
        <p class="service-item-text">
          On the last day, we canoed back from Tom Thomson Lake to our starting point. The wind was against us, which
          made paddling harder than expected, but the weather was good. There was a light breeze and some clouds that
          gave
          us breaks from the sun.

        <p class="service-item-text">
          We snacked on mini Pepsis and granola bars along the way, which kept us going. The paddling was tough, but
          we made it back to the starting point without any major issues.
        </p><br>

        <!-- Wildlife -->
        <h4 class="h4 service-item-title small-article-title">Wildlife Encounters</h4>
        <p class="service-item-text">
          The trip was full of wildlife sightings. I saw river otters, beavers, loons, frogs, a bald eagle, and a mouse.
          I also spotted a woodpecker, which was a cool surprise. At night, I heard an owl and a bat, though I didn't manage
          to catch a glimpse of either.
